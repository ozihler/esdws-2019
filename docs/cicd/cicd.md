# CI CD
## Continuous Delivery
* common problem: how to release implemented code quickly/safely and sustainably?
* Solution: Continuous Delivery
** automates manual tasks so users receive new features right after implementation

## Traditional Delivery Process
* See image introducing traditional delivery process
* Three phases after requirements: development, quality assurance (tests), operations
** shortcomings: slow delivery (outdated requirements), long feedback cycle (users, developers),
lack of automation (unpredictable releases), risky hotfixes (barely tested), stress (ops, teams), 
poor communication (over the fence --> blaming game), shared responsibility (no team takes it), 
lower job satisfaction

## Benefits of CD
* Goal: change each phase of the traditional delivery process into a sequence of scripts (automated deployment pipeline/CD pipeline)
** Benefits: fast delivery, fast feedback cycle, low-risk releases, flexible release options

## The automated deployment pipeline
* Goal: automate as much as possible of the 3 phases (dev, UAT, Ops)
* Code Change 
--> Continuous Integration (code integrates together) 
--> Automated Acceptance Testing (implemented features meet client's requirements)
--> Configuration Management (configures & deploys software)
* CD Pipeline = sequence of scripts, execute after every committed code change. Success = deploy to production

## Continuous Integration 
* anything fails: pipeline execution stops --> devs fix it
* needs to be fast (not hours!)
* simple to define (is part of development, no agreement with QA/Ops needed)

## Automated Acceptance Testing
* Suite of tests written together with Clients and QAs
* Replaces manual UAT
* Quality gate (is product ready for release?)
* Fail --> Pipeline stops, no release
* Goal: build quality into product, not verify it later
* most difficult to automate: requires client cooperation and creating tests in the beginning (not end)
* What to test and where? Agile testing matrix:
** Acceptance Testing (automated): functional requirements from business view. Stories/Examples written by clients/devs to agree on how the SW should work
** Unit Testing (automated): help devs provide high-quality SW, minimise # bugs
** Exploratory (manual): manual blackbox testing (to break or improve the system)
** Non-functional testing (automated): test performance, scalability, security, etc. 
* Role of a QA in CD: 
** Manual QA:  Exploratory testing
** AUtomation QAs: help with non-functional/acceptance testing (e.g. write code to support load testing)
** no special place, just part of the development team
* Where are integration tests? Somewhere between acceptance/unit tests, more technical than acceptance. 
Implemented as a separate phase in the continuous delivery pipeline
